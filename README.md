# 🛠 My Development Environment Setup
Welcome to my personal development environment setup!  
Here, I've documented the specifics of my environment for both my own reference and for anyone who might find it useful. 🌍


## 🖥 Why macOS?
I mainly prefer to use **macOS** for a couple of reasons:

1️⃣ **Unix-based:**  
Being Unix-based, macOS comes with a number of built-in tools and utilities that can be very handy for developers.  
It offers the power of Unix, but with a beautiful and user-friendly interface.

2️⃣ **iOS Development:**  
If you're into iOS development, then macOS is a must.  
Apple's development tools such as Xcode and Swift Playgrounds only run on macOS, making it the primary choice for iOS developers.


## 📦 What's Inside?
This repository contains setup scripts, configuration files, and guides for the following:

- Package managers *(e.g. Homebrew, Chocolatey, PNPM)*
- Nerd Fonts
- Terminal / Shell config & theming
- Apps
- Compilers / Runtimes

Feel free to use this as a starting point for setting up your own development environment! 👍
